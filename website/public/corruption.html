<h3>Corruptionand it's many faces</h3>
<p>most people seem to think corruption is to do with poletics and only that. <br>Corruption on 
earth is at an all time high in our generation. Stangly, most people are ignorant of it 
and some even part take in this <br>corruption thinking it's a good thing. They know nothing
about what they are doing.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Killing <p>complete genocides and mass murder of humans and livestock for no reason <br>
        a US congress woman has killed off thousands of livestock by poisoning thier water <br> 
        because apparently caws fart too much and are increasing golabal warming.
    </p></li>
    <li>Corruption of people and thier culture <p> normalising all the wrong things and completely 
        crushing the pride of a community
    </p></li>
    <li>Corruption of history <p> Teaching hcildren at school that humans are decendents of apes
        hiding the existance of the devil <br> from the minds of children and teaching them that <br> religion is arelic of the past. in truth 
    god is real. Our number one enemythe devil is also here on earth. how does someone defend <br> themeselves 
from the enemy if you hide his existance from them? surly the soldiers of satan run the public schooling systems in the west
 </p></li>
    <li>Corruption of religion <p>We live in an era where satans worhsipers call themselves the Light when in fact they are the darkness. <br>
    Man has been brainwashed into thinking that humans are capable with out guidance from God. <br> Satan did promise 
    he would crush and delude most of the humans on earth except for the few who submit to god. <br>That promise 
    stands true today. This is truly something to fear.</p>
